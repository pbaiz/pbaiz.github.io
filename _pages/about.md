Welcome to my personal webpage! You will find here information about professional and personal projects, as my personal hobby spins around the idea of supporting the 17 UN SDG (UN Sustainable Development Goals specially with Tech), personal and professional projects can hugely overlap. 

I have a background in engineering with extensive experience in academia (over 50 papers/conferences) and industry (consultant in data driven projects with some of the largest organisations in the UK such as Heathrow Airport, HSBC and more). I have deep knowledge of data technologies (e.g. Machine Learning, IoT, Blockchain) and Digital Transformation programs. 

I am an experienced consultant that holds positions across a range of organisations; for example since 2018, I was appointed as the first Royal Society Entrepreneur in Residence at Imperial College London; since summer 2019 I hold the position of UK representative to the Chairman Advisory Group (CAG) for ISO TC 322 (International Standard on Sustainable Finance), since July 2021 I became the CTO and co-founder of Clearly (start-up focused on tracking scope 3 emissions in transport), since September 2021 I became the Convener of TAG1 for TC322 (Lead FinTech Advisory for TC322). I am also an advisor to several start-ups focused on “data technologies” and/or “sustainability”. All of my engagements spin around the central idea of using “Data and Digital Technologies” to support the 17 SDGs.
